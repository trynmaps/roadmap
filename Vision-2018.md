As congestion and transportation demand continue to increase, the mobility afforded by Muni has continued to decrease. That’s why many people take unsustainable alternatives such as Uber or Lyft, which increase congestion, are unaffordable for many residents, and decrease the quality of life for everyone.

Public support is essential to initiating, planning, and implementing transit improvements, which is why we’re focusing on increasing community engagement with transit planning.

We want to increase community engagement by:

(Summer 2018)
1.	Making Muni’s GPS data open, providing and visualizing flexible mobility, speed, and reliability metrics derived from any segment of any route for any period of time.
1.1	Can access GPS coordinates of transit vehicles during any time interval and see them on a map (completed)
1.2	Can access speed and reliability information of route segments during any time interval and visualize them on a map (in-progress)
1.3	Can determine travel-times between two points at any given past point in time
1.4	Can generate isochrones shapes that demonstrate mobility from a particular place at any given past point in time and draw them on a map (in-progress)
1.5	Can generate links for sharing visualizations on a map
1.6	Users can track the reliability of their commute and of their mobility from their neighborhood using Muni
1.7	Call-to-action – can share on Twitter, being able to tag the SFMTA, transit advocacy groups, and their local political representation

(Fall 2018)
2	Creating a visualization framework that will allow planners to clearly communicate the impacts of a transit improvement on our web-app to residents.
2.1	Can see proposed and ongoing projects on a map along with which routes they affect.

3	Allowing users on our web-app to see how certain transit improvements will affect them and to send support or feedback.
3.1	Can see how various projects could impact your public-transit trips
3.2	Can ask questions or comment on projects on the map as well as directly send feedback to the transit agency
